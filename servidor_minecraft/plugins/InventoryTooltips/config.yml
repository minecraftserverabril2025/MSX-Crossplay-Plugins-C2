# This is the configuration file for InventoryTooltips
# Made by Plotzes



# This setting defines how big the items in the tooltips should be, measured in blocks.
# The higher the number, the bigger the tooltips will be.
item_size: 0.25


# This setting defines the duration of the tooltip opening and closing animations.
# It is measured in ticks (1 tick = 0.05 sec). The higher the number, the slower the animation.
animation_duration: 5


# If this setting is enabled, all tooltips will be in front of the container instead of above the container.
# A container with a block above it will always have its tooltip in front of the container.
